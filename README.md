# Custom Video Player

Day 11 of the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)!  I was really excited to reach this challenge because I knew I would learn so much.

In this project we created a video player with features to adjust volume and playback speed, skip ahead or back, choose a new timestamp on the progress bar and enable fullscreen.

## What I learned
- how to create a fullscreen option; this was a stretch feature I decided to add to the project
- the capabilities of the .paused property
- how to match the progress bar with the corresponding time of the video clip using the .currentTime property
